# Dreamspace Guidelines
A set of guidelines followed at DreamSpace as code of conduct.

- [Naming Convention](#naming-convention)
- [Software Tools](#software-tools)


## [Naming Convention](#naming-convention)

- We are using [Kebab Case](https://medium.com/better-programming/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841) naming convention for files. That means all letters are small and use hypen (- symbol) instead of spaces.
For example : "core-team-meeting.doc"

- If acronyms are used, then it can be in capital letters.
For ex: "ABC-partnerships.doc"

## [Software Tools](#software-tools)

Slack
  : Internal Communication, Asynchronous Decision Making & Theme Based Channel.
  : Asynchronous decision-making is a strategy that enables geographically and culturally distributed teams to make decisions more efficiently.
