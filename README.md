## [Naming Convention](#naming-convention)

- We are using [Kebab Case](https://medium.com/better-programming/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841) naming convention for files. That means all letters are small and use hypen (- symbol) instead of spaces. For example : "core-team-meeting.doc"

- If acronyms are used, then it can be in capital letters. For ex: "ABC-partnerships.doc"
